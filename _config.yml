          I am currently learning quantum computing from scratch using the book ["Quantum Computing for Programmers" by Robert Hundt](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computing-for-programmers/BA1C887BE4AC0D0D5653E71FFBEF61C6). 
          Understanding how to design algorithms for quantum computing will be crucial in the near future. 
          I am passionate about learning and applying this cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems.
          I will document my journey in the above git project.

            In my role as a Data Scientist in the Market Analytics team, I excelled in crafting targeted 
            campaign frameworks aimed at achieving maximum return on investment (ROI). Furthermore, 
            I effectively streamlined various frameworks, resulting in a substantial reduction in 
            cloud resource consumption.

          I was awarded three consecutive [Mitacs Accelerate Fellowships](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/accelerate-fellowship-professors/), 
          totaling three years, to collaborate with FreshBooks. 
          
          As a Data Scientist (PhD Intern), I conducted in-depth data analysis, developed models to enhance data efficiency, 
          and provided valuable customer insights to guide decision-making. I also designed and implemented fraud detection 
          and invoice categorization frameworks to optimize organizational processes.

          **Thesis:** [Big Data Clustering - Models and Applications](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/28504)

          As part of the [Marketing and Supply Chain Analytics (MiSCAN)](https://miscan.mcmaster.ca) Lab and [Professor Elkafi Hassini](https://research.degroote.mcmaster.ca/profiles/profile/?user=hassini)'s research team, my primary research focus was designing heuristic 
          clustering algorithms to identify communities in large-scale empirical networks. 
          During my Ph.D., I had the privilege of receiving three [Mitacs Accelerate Fellowships](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/accelerate-fellowship-students-postdocs) 
          and working with [FreshBooks Inc.](https://www.freshbooks.com) to solve complex business problems.

          At UBC, under [Professor Yong Gao](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/yong-gao/)'s supervision, my research focused on designing random models 
          and analyzing signed-directed social networks.

          In addition to exploring the beautiful and hilly campus of the University of Chittagong, 
          I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in pure mathematics, specializing in fundamental analysis and 
          numerical analysis. These areas of study have helped me refine my analytical 
          and logical skills, which I utilize to solve complex problems in diverse professional 
          environments.
